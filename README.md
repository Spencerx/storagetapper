StorageTapper is a scalable realtime MySQL change data streaming, logical backup
and logical replication service.

Storagetapper is deployed in production at Uber and used to produce snapshot and
realtime changed data of thousands of MySQL tables across multiple datacenters.

It is also used as a backup service to snapshot hundreds of terrabytes
of Schemaless data to HDFS and S3 with optional asymmetric encryption and
compression.

It reads data from source transforms according to the specified event
format and produces data to destination.

Supported event sources:
* MySQL
* Schemaless

Supported event destinations:
* Kafka
* HDFS
* S3
* Local file
* MySQL (experimental)
* Postgres (experimental)
* Clickhouse (experimental)

Supported event formats:
* Avro
* [JSON](./doc/commonformat.md)
* MsgPack
* SQL

Features:
* Fields filtering
* Snapshot row filtering
* Producing realtime changes only, i.e. omitting initial snapshot
* Snapshot and changelog events ordering
* Periodic snapshots
* Snapshot index hinting

Storagetapper keeps its jobs state in MySQL database and automatically distributes jobs
between configured number of workers.

It is also aware of node roles and takes snapshot from the slave nodes in order 
to reduce load on master nodes. StorageTapper can also optionally further throttle its reads.
Binlogs are streamed from master nodes for better SLAs.

Service is dynamically configurable through [RESTful API](./doc/endpoints.md) or
built-in UI.
